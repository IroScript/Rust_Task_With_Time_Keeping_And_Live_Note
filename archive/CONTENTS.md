# Project Archive

This directory contains files and folders that are no longer necessary for the main application's development or production but are kept for historical reference.

## Folders
- **[RotateTest](file:///c:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Desktop/Irak/rustV10/archive/RotateTest)**: A standalone Rust project used to prototype the window rotation and bouncing features before they were integrated into the main application.

## Prototypes & Legacy Code
- **[index.html](file:///c:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Desktop/Irak/rustV10/archive/index.html)**: An early web-based (HTML/CSS) prototype of the "Daily Motivation" UI. The current application is implemented in pure Rust using `egui`.

## Logs & Reports
These files were generated during development, debugging, and verification phases:
- **Runtime Logs**: `debug.log`, `error.log`, `error_utf8.log`, `error_utf8_2.log`.
- **Build & Error Reports**: `build_err.txt`, `err.txt`, `err_utf8.log`.
- **Compiler Checks**: `cargo_check_output.txt`, `cargo_check_results.txt`, `check_output.txt`, `check_out.txt`, `check_out_final.txt`.
- **Layout & Debug Output**: `layout.txt`, `output.txt`, `check.txt`.

## Media
- **[difference.png](file:///c:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Desktop/Irak/rustV10/archive/difference.png)**: A visual artifact used for comparing UI layouts or rendering differences during the development of the 3D background.
